## Getting Started
Sign up for the demo wallets and start sending Interledger payments between them in under 3 minutes.

First, create an account on the [Red Demo Wallet](https://red.ilpdemo.org/) and the [Blue Demo Wallet](https://blue.ilpdemo.org/) (one for sending and the other for receiving).

And they arrive instantly, even though they are on different ledgers.
